# ObsidianEngine

ObsidianEngine is a modular based system to modify jars on runtime. ObsidianEngine can be used to inject class files before the main jar is loaded or after the jar is loaded. ObsidianEngine can also be used for asm bytecode editing or anything else you can really thing of. The module system is inspired by the way that Bukkit loads plugins.
